          <p>
            Hi, I'm Arwin Silpakar, a student at Sydney Technical High School
            with a major passion for robotics, electronics, and all things
            computer-related. I love building projects from scratch, whether
            it’s designing a custom PCB, creating a Discord bot, or designing a
            custom keyboard. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them
            to real-world projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ever since I was young, I was fascinated by computers and how they
            worked. I used to see them as magical black boxes that could take
            inputs and produce exactly what I wanted. As I grew older, my
            curiosity led me to explore programming, electronics, and robotics.
            Over the years, I’ve become a jack of all trades, experimenting with
            different things to develop both my technical skills and my
            problem-solving abilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m a part of the UNSW Robotics team, EMU 4729 and my role is mainly
            coding. Using the knowledge I had gained from EMU, I started my own
            robotics team at school where I led a group of students to create a
            robot for FTC. In 2025, both the teams I was a part of managed to
            make it to nationals at Macquarie University where we were up
            against teams from all across Australia. In 2026, I have had the
            honour of being invited to New York to compete at a FRC robotics
            competition with EMU.
          </p>

          <p>
            Academically, I’m good at all the technical subjects. Outside of
            computers, I love math and science. Learning about the world and how
            it is governed by these fundamental laws just seems so cool to me.
            I’ve also won many awards in relation to math, science and computer
            technology including duxxing Computer Technology and getting a
            Science Scholarship.
          </p>

          <p>
            Looking ahead, I hope to continue creating, combining my passions in
            robotics, software development and computers. Every project I
            undertake teaches me something new and fuels my excitement to
            innovate further.

              I'm raising funds to attend a robotics competition in America.
              Your support will help cover travel, accommodation, and equipment
              costs. Every contribution brings me closer to representing my team
              at this international event! Anything you give is appreciated so
              genuinely thank you so much.
